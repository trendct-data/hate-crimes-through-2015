# Per-capita analysis of hate crimes

Because of numerous problems with this data
(http://trendct.org/2016/11/21/connecticut-saw-a-drop-in-reports-of-hate-crime-incidents-in-2015/)
naive year-to-year comparisons of total hate-crime incidents are not
particularly informative, and at worst misleading. They don't take into
account that the number of police agencies participating changes from year
to year, and that the list of agencies participating could be completely
different. If high-hate-crime jurisdictions go on and off the list, the
appearance of significant swings could result.
